Onehalf theme based on [lush](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim) forked from [zorgick/onehalf-lua](https://github.com/zorgick/onehalf-lua) with my flavour.

# Usage

Example with packer: 

```lua
use({
  "zorgick/onehalf-lua",
  requires = {
    "rktjmp/lush.nvim",
  },
  disable = false,
}),
```
